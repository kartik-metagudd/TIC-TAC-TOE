Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe!
The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Here are the rules:

The board looks like this at the start, with the coordinates:
(0,0) | (0,1) | (0,2)
------|-------|-------
(1,0) | (1,1) | (1,2)
------|-------|-------
(2,0) | (2,1) | (2,2)

Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in an empty spot on the grid.

To win, you need to get three of your marks in a row. For example:
 X | X | X
---|---|---
   |   |  
---|---|---
   |   |  
This is a horizontal win for X!

You can also win by getting three in a column:
 O |   |  
---|---|---
 O |   |  
---|---|---
 O |   |  
This is a vertical win for O!

Or diagonally:
 X |   |  
---|---|---
   | X |  
---|---|---
   |   | X
This is a diagonal win for X!

If all 9 spaces are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
